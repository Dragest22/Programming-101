    <h1><center>Major Objectives</center></h1>
    <p>
        <br />1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, 
        connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and 
        security components in the design. <br /> <br />
        2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, 
        vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch 
        management, auditing and assessment. <br /> <br />
        3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as 
        installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, 
        analysis and assessment. <br /> <br />
        4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an 
        incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, 
        assessments or troubleshooting procedures. <br /> <br />
        5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements 
        that pertain to information security. <br /> <br />
        6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious 
        activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of 
        sensitive information and data confidentiality, integrity and availability. <br /> <br />
