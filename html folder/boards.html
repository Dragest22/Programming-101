    <h1>Major Objectives</h1>
    <p>
        1. Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components, 
        connections to the outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including operational and 
        security components in the design.
        2. Install, configure and test security hardware and software tools with supporting documentation such as port scanners, 
        vulnerability detection systems, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, system hardening, anti-virus tools, patch 
        management, auditing and assessment.
        3. Construct, implement and document a script or a program to automate a security-related process or other tasks such as 
        installation, administration, management, mapping resources, logon scripts, patch management, updates, auditing, 
        analysis and assessment.
        4. Create a policy or procedure that addresses events such as: a disaster recovery plan, a business continuity plan, an 
        incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical security policy, 
        assessments or troubleshooting procedures.
        5. Develop a research report or implementation plan concerning legal and ethical best practices and mandated requirements 
        that pertain to information security.
        6. Research, document, test and evaluate several current industry information security-based threats, risks, malicious 
        activities, covert methodology, encryption technologies, mitigation techniques or unconventional tactics to prevent loss of 
        sensitive information and dataa confidentiality, integrity and availability.
